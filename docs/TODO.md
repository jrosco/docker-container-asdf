# TODO

- Follow docker versioning similar to [docker-node](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node)
- Look at adding a way to sign packages that support it

```bash
Could not set tfc-agent to version 1.14.0. Installing ...
Downloading tfc-agent version 1.14.0 from https://releases.hashicorp.com/tfc-agent/1.14.0/tfc-agent_1.14.0_linux_amd64.zip
Skipping verifying signatures and checksums either because gpg is not installed or explicitly skipped with ASDF_HASHICORP_SKIP_VERIFY
Cleaning tfc-agent previous binaries
```

- Add a way / script to clean after installing a tool set
