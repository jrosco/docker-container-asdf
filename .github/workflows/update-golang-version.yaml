              * Updated `GOLANG_VERSION` to the latest release.
              * Adjusted `GOLANG_MAJOR_VERSION`, `GOLANG_MINOR_VERSION`, and `GOLANG_PATCH_VERSION` based on the new version.

            ðŸ›  How this works:
              * The bot runs on a scheduled workflow to check for new golang releases.

              * This ensures we always stay up to date with the latest improvements and security patches.
