              * Updated `DEBIAN_VERSION` to the latest release.
              * Adjusted `DEBIAN_MAJOR_VERSION`, and `DEBIAN_MINOR_VERSION` based on the new version.

            ðŸ›  How this works:
              * The bot runs on a scheduled workflow to check for new Debian releases.
              * If a new version is found, it updates the configuration file and creates this PR.
              * This ensures we always stay up to date with the latest improvements and security patches.

            ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:
              * Review the changes.
